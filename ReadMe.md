## Phase 1: Pre-Engagement Activities

sample_pentest_agreement: A comprehensive template for a Penetration Testing Agreement (SOW/ROE).

## Phase 2: Reconnaissance & Information Gathering

### Project 1: Performing Passive Reconnaissance

Tools Used: Google Dorks, Shodan, WHOIS, Maltego (open-source intelligence).

Objective: Gather non-intrusive information without direct interaction.

### Project 2: Performing Active Reconnaissance

Tools Used: Nmap, DNS enumeration tools (e.g., dig, nslookup).

Objective: Map the target's network topology and identify live hosts.
