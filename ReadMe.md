# Phase 2: Reconnaissance & Information Gathering

## Project 1: Performing Passive Reconnaissance

An information-gathering technique known as "passive reconnaissance" involves the tools not interacting directly with the target device or network.

**Lab 1: Using USINT Tools**

In this lab, I have explored several OSINT tools that are commonly used by pentesters. This includes the following:
* Examining the different OSINT resources
* Using SpiderFoot
* Investigating with Recon-ng
* Finding interesting files with Recon-ng

## Project 2: Performing Active Reconnaissance

**Active reconnaissance** is a technique for obtaining information in which the instruments employed actually send enquiries to the target network or systems to elicit responses that are subsequently utilised to ascertain the network or system's condition.

**Lab 1: Enumeration with Nmap**

In this lab, I have learned the different types of Nmap scans and done a basic Nmap scan.

**Lab 2: Packet Crafting with Scrapy**

In this lab, I have learned how to investigate with the scapy tool, used scapy to sniff network traffic, create and send ICMP packets, and create and send TCP SYN packets.

**Lab 3: Network Sniffing with Wireshark**

In this lab, I have learned how to prepare the host to capture network traffic, capture and save network traffic, and view and analyze packet capture.
